"""
figure.py — a single image pane, created once and repainted in place.

The smallest correct anyplotlib figure a shell app can own. Creating one emits
its HTML to the renderer, which mounts it in an iframe keyed by ``fig_id``;
every later frame is a ``set_data`` push down the same channel, so the iframe is
never rebuilt and the user's zoom survives the next frame.

**This is deliberately the small shape, not SpyDE's.** SpyDE's ``Plot`` carries
the array cache, the tiered navigator read, overlay layers and tile mode — all
of which exist because it displays multi-gigabyte lazy datasets on disk. A live
camera hands over a frame that is already in RAM, so none of it applies. The
shared wrapper is the in-memory core; an app that needs the out-of-core
machinery layers it on top rather than the shell carrying it for everyone.

It satisfies the WindowController protocol (a ``window_id`` and a ``close()``),
so a session's window registry can own its lifetime.

Two things here are easy to get wrong and cost a debugging session each; both
are enforced rather than documented-and-hoped:

* **Registration mints the fig_id.** ``_electron.register(fig)`` attaches the
  trait observers that turn a later ``set_data`` into a push, and returns the id
  the renderer routes those pushes by. Inventing an id instead leaves the figure
  unregistered: it mounts, sizes and titles correctly, and then never updates,
  with no error anywhere.
* **Levels are robust by default.** One hot pixel — which every real detector
  has — sets the ceiling under a plain min/max and renders the whole image
  black.

#: transforms — so a scrolled figure document is always this artefact and never

#: re-fire, so this settles rather than loops.
#: BOTH boxes, deliberately: which one actually scrolls depends on the overflow

        The handler receives an `Event` whose ``xdata``/``ydata`` are in DATA
        space — image pixels for an ``imshow`` — which is what a caller
        measuring in the image wants, not canvas pixels.

        Handlers fire on the asyncio main thread (the stdin reader dispatches
        them), so a slow one blocks every other message: hand real work to a
        worker rather than doing it inline.

        Returns a no-op decorator when the figure is not open, so registration
        at construction time is safe.

        WIDGETS, not raw pointer handlers, are the working way to get user
        geometry out of an anyplotlib figure: the plot owns the hit-testing and
        pushes the new state back, whereas a bare `pointer_down` never arrives
        (the plot's own pan consumes it).

        `on_change(cx, cy, r)` fires on ``pointer_up`` — when the drag settles —
        not on every frame, so a callback that recomputes something expensive
        does not run sixty times a second.

        `lock_center` pins the centre and lets only the radius change. On a
        power spectrum the centre IS the DC term, so a draggable one is a
        control that can only ever be wrong — and a ring nudged off-centre
        silently corrupts every radius measured from it. anyplotlib enforces it
        in the HIT-TEST: a grab on the ring body is refused outright, so the
        centre never moves at all.

        `linewidth` and `show_handles` are anyplotlib's own, passed through at
        its own defaults. They matter for a circle used as an ANNOTATION rather
        than a control: a set of them drawn at the default 2 px with grab
        handles reads as a cluster of filled discs and a row of dots, which
        obscures the very image it is marking up. A caller drawing many should
        thin them and drop the handles — a handle on something nothing reads
        back is an affordance that promises an effect it does not have.
