/**
 * harness.test.cjs — node:test unit tests for the harness's failure paths.
 *
 * Two teardown/startup behaviours learned the hard way:
 *
 *   1. A window that never appears must fail with the BACKEND LOG attached —
 *      Playwright's bare "firstWindow timeout" hides the uv/env error that
 *      caused it.
 *   2. `app.close()` can wedge (a backend stuck mid-compute holds quit up), and
 *      a wedged close leaves the Electron tree alive holding the DE Server's
 *      single connection — so teardown needs a deadline and a hard tree-kill.
 *
 * Run: `node --test src/harness.test.cjs` (from packages/shell-testing/), or
 * via the `test:unit` npm script.
