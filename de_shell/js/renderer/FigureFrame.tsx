/**
 * FigureFrame.tsx — an anyplotlib figure in an iframe, wired to the bridge.
 *
 * Handles the three things every host of a figure has to get right, and which
 * are easy to omit without any error appearing:
 *
 * * **Register with the bridge**, so state can be routed to this frame — and
 *   deregister on unmount, so a dead element is not held. In an EFFECT
 *   (`attachFigure`), not the ref callback alone: StrictMode's double-invoke
 *   otherwise leaves the figure registered nowhere, and everything pushed to it
 *   afterwards goes into the void.
 * * **Replay on load**, passing THIS element. State that arrived before the
 *   frame mounted was posted into the void; replay is the only thing that
 *   recovers it, and a figure mounted twice must serve itself rather than
 *   whichever mount happens to hold the registry slot.
 * * **Report its size**, so the backend can lay the figure out to fit. Without
 *   it the figure renders at anyplotlib's default size and overflows its pane.
 *
 * `srcdoc` vs `src`: a backend that inlines the figure's ESM can be mounted
 * directly from `html`. One that swaps the bundle for a shared URL (SpyDE does,
 * so Chromium reuses the V8 code cache across many figure iframes) MUST be
 * served over a real origin and passes `fileUrl` instead — a srcdoc frame
 * cannot load it. Note that a srcdoc frame INHERITS the parent page's CSP, so
 * the host page needs `script-src … blob:` for anyplotlib's ESM boot.
