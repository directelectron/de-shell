# Changelog

All notable changes to `de-shell`. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), the versioning is
[semver](https://semver.org/) with the 0.x caveat: a breaking change to the
sidecar protocol bumps the minor.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-02

Ground Crew's shell work from after the merge base, so it can move onto the
package too.

### Added
- `createStdoutDemux` (main): the sidecar's stdout demuxer as a chunk-list
  accumulator that copies each byte once. The inline parser re-copied the
  whole buffered prefix per chunk, O(N^2/chunkSize) while a large frame
  streamed in (11.9 s per 64 MB frame at 64 KiB chunks). A malformed
  `PLOTAPP:` line is now reported on stderr rather than swallowed.
- `createSizeReporter` (renderer): `FigureFrame` skips the zero-size first
  layout and any resize whose rounded size is unchanged, and holds its
  `onResize` in a ref so an inline callback no longer re-runs the effect
  (measured at ~1,500 sends/s over constant geometry before).
- `attachFigure` (renderer): figure registration is owned by an effect and
  re-registers on every run, so React StrictMode's double-invoke no longer
  leaves a figure registered nowhere with its pane black.
- `PIN_SCROLL`: every figure document undoes the focus-scroll that shifted a
  fresh pane by half its overflow on first hover.

### Changed
- anyplotlib floor raised to 0.8.0, for its fix to a tiled image born on a
  placeholder rendering solid black.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-02

The first release as its own package. Until now the shell lived as a vendored
copy inside each of SpyDE, Ground Crew and Autopilot, and the three had
diverged.

### Added
- **One package.** The TypeScript half (`de_shell/js`: the Electron main
  process, the preload bridge, the React renderer kernel, the Playwright
  harness) ships inside the wheel, so `pip install -U de-shell` moves both
  halves of the sidecar protocol together. `python -m de_shell.js` prints where
  the tree is; apps link it into their Electron project.
- From SpyDE 0.4.3: the problem reporter (`errorReport`, `problemLog`,
  `sentryEnvelope`), `recentBackendOutput`, workspace-member wheels in the
  environment setup, an update handoff that tree-kills the sidecar first,
  `run_on_worker`'s in-flight count and `ComputeHandle` for cancelling a
  superseded compute.
- From Ground Crew: the sidecar spawn-error trap, a 5 s tree-kill grace, a
  resolved `uv` path, the open-directory dialog channel, `_pin_tile_band` for
  large stills, JSON emit that never writes bare `NaN`, harness hardening, and
  the unit tests for all of it.
- From Autopilot: the close handler forgets only its own child process, a
  report for malformed protocol messages, `useFigureEventForwarding`, and a
  `LOG_CLEAR` action in the renderer state.

### Changed
- License: MIT (the vendored copies were GPL-3.0-or-later inside SpyDE).
- Line endings are LF throughout, enforced by `.gitattributes`.
